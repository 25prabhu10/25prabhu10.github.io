I received a written offer for one of the positions that would be an excellent fit for my qualifications and this offer was received after we scheduled this interview. The truth is, I believe the position you are offering me is an even better fit for my qualifications, but the salary you are offering is less than the other offer I have. This presents a challenging dilemma for me as you might imagine. Is there a possibility of meeting or improving upon the salary identified in this other offer? I can show you the other offer if that would be helpful.&quot;</p><ol><li><a href="./General.html">General</a></li><li><a href="./ASP_NET.html">ASP.NET</a></li><li><a href="./BackEnd.html">BackEnd</a></li><li><a href="./C_Sharp.html">C-Sharp</a></li><li><a href="./Database.html">Database</a></li><li><a href="./FrontEnd.html">FrontEnd</a></li><li><a href="./Roles_and_Responsibilities.html">Roles and Responsibilities</a></li><li><a href="./LinkedIn.html">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="./temp.html">Temp</a></li></ol><h2 id="temp" tabindex="-1">Temp <a class="header-anchor" href="#temp" aria-label="Permalink to “Temp”">​</a></h2><p>Seeking an Onsite Opportunity (serving notice period) Dear All,</p><p>I am a Full-Stack Developer having 6+ years of experience.
