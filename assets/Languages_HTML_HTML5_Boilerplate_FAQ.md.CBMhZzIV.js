The only real advantage is to catch a pageView call if your page fails to load completely (for example, if the user aborts loading, or quickly closes the page, etc.). Personally, I wouldn&#39;t count that as a page view, so I actually prefer to place this script at the bottom, after all other scripts. This keeps all the scripts together and reinforces that scripts at the bottom are the right move. (Usually I concatenate and minify all my scripts into one .js file - the GA snippet being the suffix.)</p></blockquote><h3 id="do-i-need-to-upgrade-my-site-each-time-a-new-version-of-html5-boilerplate-is-released" tabindex="-1">Do I need to upgrade my site each time a new version of HTML5 Boilerplate is released? <a class="header-anchor" href="#do-i-need-to-upgrade-my-site-each-time-a-new-version-of-html5-boilerplate-is-released" aria-label="Permalink to “Do I need to upgrade my site each time a new version of HTML5 Boilerplate is released?”">​</a></h3><p>No, just as you don&#39;t normally replace the foundation of a house once it was built.
