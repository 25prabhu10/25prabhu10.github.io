These records are often used for email security</td></tr><tr><td>NS</td><td>Stores the name server for a DNS entry</td></tr><tr><td>SOA</td><td>Stores admin information about a domain</td></tr><tr><td>SRV</td><td>Specifies a port for specific services</td></tr><tr><td>PTR</td><td>Provides a domain name in reverse-lookups</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Less common:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>AFSDB</td><td>This record is used for clients of the Andrew File System (AFS) developed by Carnegie Melon.
