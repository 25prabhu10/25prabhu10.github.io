For example, by using a larger buffer and poll less often you can get much better performance while sacrificing latency</p><p>TCP is optimized for high speed bulk transfers while UDP is optimized for low latency in the Linux kernel.

They are often used in computer networking, where they are used to connect computers and other devices to the Internet. Twisted pair cables are also used in telephone systems, where they are used to connect telephones to the telephone network. Twisted pair cables are made up of pairs of insulated wires that are twisted together. The twisting of the wires helps to reduce electromagnetic interference and crosstalk. There are several different types of twisted pair cables, including unshielded twisted pair (UTP), shielded twisted pair (STP), foil twisted pair (FTP), and shielded foil twisted pair (S/FTP). Each type of twisted pair cable has its own advantages and disadvantages, and is used in different applications</p><h3 id="cable-types" tabindex="-1">Cable Types <a class="header-anchor" href="#cable-types" aria-label="Permalink to “Cable Types”">​</a></h3><p>There are several different types of twisted pair cables, including unshielded twisted pair (UTP), shielded twisted pair (STP), foil twisted pair (FTP), and shielded foil twisted pair (S/FTP).
