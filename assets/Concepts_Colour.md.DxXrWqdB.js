Complementary colours are colours that are opposite each other on the colour wheel, such as red and green.

Colour temperature is important in photography, film, and lighting design, as it can affect the mood and atmosphere of a scene</p><p>White balance is the process of adjusting the colour temperature of an image to make it appear more natural.
