A process instance is a concrete execution of a process model. It&#39;s created when a process is initiated and represents a specific occurrence of the process</p><ul><li>One single customer complaint is an instance of the complaint process, for example. Some processes may be instantiated only a few times in a year, such as end-of-quarter reporting in the accounting department</li><li>Other instances occur more often.

You can apply the token model, if you have a process model in mind and want to find out which process paths must or may be used during a process instance</p><ul><li>A token is a concept we compare to a car: A car follows a road. At an intersection, its driver must decide to continue in a straight path or to turn left or right. Or perhaps the car turns and a clone of the car continues straight on</li><li>This is where the car metaphor breaks down, but we hope you get the gist: that the road system corresponds to a process model and that any particular route the car takes represents an instance</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Correlation</strong>: It is is a mechanism for linking multiple process instances together based on shared data or business keys</p><ul><li>Do you ever get letters with a transaction key or a file number? When you reply, you are expected to reference the key or number to make it easier for your correspondent to allocate your communication properly. This allocation based on an unambiguous key is called correlation.</li><li>Another example is when you pay a bill, and you are asked to write the invoice number on your check. If you don&#39;t comply, your payment may not be properly allocated, and the lack of correlation can lead to reminder notices, late-payment fees, and other unpleasantness</li><li>Correlation is often crucial to the success of processes, from both organizational and technical points of view.

BPMN does not require you to model start and end events for a process —you can leave them out —but if you model a start event, you must model an end event for each path. The same is true for end events that require start events. We always create our models with start and end events for two reasons: first, that way it&#39;s possible to determine the process trigger, and second, you can describe the final status of each path end.
