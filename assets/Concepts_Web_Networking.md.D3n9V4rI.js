As you start stressing the stack by sending high speed data you will fill up these buffers and either block or lose data. You also have strategies for timeliness and polling that can impact your performance. For example, by using a larger buffer and poll less often you can get much better performance while sacrificing latency</p><p>TCP is optimized for high speed bulk transfers while UDP is optimized for low latency in the Linux kernel. This has an impact on buffer sizes and how data is polled and handed over. In addition to this, you frequently have offloading to hardware for TCP. I would expect considerably better performance for TCP compared to UDP</p><p>Note that sending high speed data over UDP is usually a bad idea, unless you implement your own congestion control.

They are often used in computer networking, where they are used to connect computers and other devices to the Internet. Twisted pair cables are also used in telephone systems, where they are used to connect telephones to the telephone network. Twisted pair cables are made up of pairs of insulated wires that are twisted together. The twisting of the wires helps to reduce electromagnetic interference and crosstalk. There are several different types of twisted pair cables, including unshielded twisted pair (UTP), shielded twisted pair (STP), foil twisted pair (FTP), and shielded foil twisted pair (S/FTP). Each type of twisted pair cable has its own advantages and disadvantages, and is used in different applications</p><h3 id="cable-types" tabindex="-1">Cable Types <a class="header-anchor" href="#cable-types" aria-label="Permalink to “Cable Types”">​</a></h3><p>There are several different types of twisted pair cables, including unshielded twisted pair (UTP), shielded twisted pair (STP), foil twisted pair (FTP), and shielded foil twisted pair (S/FTP).

The wires inside the cable are twisted and then shielded with a foil wrapping, then the 4-pair grouping of foiled wires are shielded by a wrapping of either foil or a flexible braided screening.
