It focuses on maintaining a continuous task flow and continuous delivery.</td></tr><tr><td>Scrum has a set of mandatory roles that you must implement. The Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Team Members</td><td>Under Kanban, no set roles are prescribed. Although, there might still be an agile coach.</td></tr><tr><td>The team commits to a specific amount of work for each iteration. If the capacity is not measured accurately, sprint might fail.</td><td>Commitment is based on capacity. Work-in-progress (WIP) limits prevent team members from working on multiple tasks</td></tr><tr><td>Planning happens iteratively at the <strong>beginning of each sprint</strong></td><td>With Kanban, there&#39;s close to 0 planning involved. It includes <strong>Just-In-Time planning</strong>, instead of planning for a bigger time period</td></tr><tr><td>Scrum <strong>limits work in progress per iteration</strong>. The development team has to commit to the number of tasks that they are ready to accomplish during the sprint</td><td>Limits work in progress by assigning a <strong>limit to the number of cards in any active-work columns</strong>. When the limit is met, no new work can enter the column until a task is completed.</td></tr><tr><td>Once the <strong>sprint begins, you aren&#39;t allowed to add any new requirements</strong>. When more tasks than planned are added, <strong>scope creep</strong> occurs</td><td>You can <strong>insert or add tasks constantly to the backlog</strong> and existing cards can get blocked or removed all together based on prioritization</td></tr><tr><td>Scrum measures productivity using a metric called <strong>velocity</strong>, which is the number of story points completed in a sprint. Uses Burndown chart and Velocity chart</td><td><strong>Lead time and cycle time</strong> are important metrics for Kanban teams. They are used to calculate the average amount of time that it takes for a task to move from start to finish. Then there is CFD.</td></tr><tr><td>On a Scrum Board, the columns are labeled to show the workflow states. At the beginning of the sprint all the stories are added to the board.</td><td>Kanban board also has the columns labeled to show the workflow states. The difference is that Kanban board has WIP limits visualized on it.</td></tr><tr><td>Ideal for projects where you want to move fast but you need some degree of planning and coordination</td><td>Kanban is the best choice when you have a lot of incoming tasks with changing priorities</td></tr><tr><td>Goal-driven projects with fixed deliverables</td><td>It is better suitable for mature teams</td></tr><tr><td>Suitable for non-mature teams</td><td>Teams involved in industries such as marketing, software development, or content creation can benefit from Kanban</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Summary:</p><table tabindex="0"><thead><tr><th>Items</th><th>Scrum</th><th>Kanban</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cadence</td><td>Regular fixed length sprints</td><td>Continuous flow</td></tr><tr><td>Release Methodology</td><td>At the end of each sprint</td><td>Continuous delivery</td></tr><tr><td>Key Metrics</td><td>Velocity</td><td>Lead time, cycle time, WIP</td></tr><tr><td>Roles</td><td>Product owner, scrum master, development team</td><td>No required roles</td></tr><tr><td>Teams</td><td>Must be cross-functional</td><td>Can be specialized</td></tr><tr><td>Modifications</td><td>Changes during the sprint are strongly discouraged</td><td>Change can happen at any time</td></tr><tr><td>WIP Limits</td><td>Limits work in progress per iteration</td><td>Limits WIP by limiting the number of cards in any active-work columns</td></tr><tr><td>Commitment</td><td>Teams are required to commit a specific amount of work</td><td>Commitment not necessary it is optional for teams</td></tr><tr><td>Storyboard</td><td>Scrum board is rest after every sprint</td><td>Kanban board is persistent, low continues for as long as the project continues</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="scrumban" tabindex="-1">SCRUMBAN <a class="header-anchor" href="#scrumban" aria-label="Permalink to “SCRUMBAN”">​</a></h2><p>Scrumban is a project management framework that combines important features of two popular agile methodologies: <strong>Scrum and Kanban</strong></p><ul><li>Scrumban provides the structure of Scrum with the flexibility and visualization of Kanban, making it a highly versatile approach to workflow management</li><li>Was initially created as a way to transition from Scrum to Kanban</li></ul>`,30)]])}var s=r(a,[[`render`,o]]);export{i as __pageData,s as default};
