For example, the source (where malicious data is read) could be the URL of the page (e.g., document.location.href), or it could be an element of the HTML, and the sink is a sensitive method call that causes the execution of the malicious data (e.g., document.write)</p>`,9)]])}var s=r(a,[[`render`,o]]);export{i as __pageData,s as default};
