transports (technologies) for communication between the client and the server:</p><ul><li><strong>WebSockets</strong>: The most efficient transport for real-time web communication</li><li><strong>Server-Sent Events (SSE)</strong>: A one-way messaging channel from the server to the client</li><li><strong>Long Polling</strong>: A request-response mechanism where the client sends a request to the server and waits for a response</li></ul><p>The order of preference for the transports is WebSockets, Server-Sent Events, and Long Polling</p><ul><li>The order in which
